# Execution Steps

compile: mix clean
         mix escript.build

running: ./project3 numNodes numRequest

# What is working 
We have implemented the Pastry protocol as described in the paper as given in the project specifications. The route and the join mechanisms are also working.

# Largest network managed

We tested for different combinations of number of nodes and number of requests. Below are some of the readings for the same:

|Nodes |Requests	|Avg Hops|
|------|--------- |-------|
|10	   |10        |1.06 	 |
|100	  |10  	     |2.25	  |
|100	  |100 	     |2.28   |
|500	  |10  	     |3.08   |
|500   |100       |3.11   |
|1000	 |10  	     |3.51   |
|1000  |100       |3.53   |
|2000  |10        |3.86   |
|10000 |20000     |4.74   |
